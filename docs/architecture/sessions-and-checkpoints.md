# Sessions and Checkpoints

## Overview

Entire CLI creates checkpoints for AI coding sessions. The system is agent-agnostic - it works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Factory AI Droid, Copilot CLI, or any tool that triggers Entire hooks.

## Domain Model

### Session

A **Session** is a unit of work. Defined in `strategy/session.go`:

```go
type Session struct {
    ID          string       // e.g., "2025-12-01-8f76b0e8-b8f1-4a87-9186-848bdd83d62e"
    Description string       // Human-readable summary (first prompt or derived)
    Strategy    string       // Strategy that created this session
    StartTime   time.Time
    Checkpoints []Checkpoint
}
```

### Checkpoint

A **Checkpoint** captures a point-in-time within a session. Defined in `strategy/session.go`:

```go
type Checkpoint struct {
    CheckpointID     id.CheckpointID // Stable 12-hex-char identifier
    Message          string          // Commit message or checkpoint description
    Timestamp        time.Time
    IsTaskCheckpoint bool            // Task checkpoint (subagent) vs session checkpoint
    ToolUseID        string          // Tool use ID for task checkpoints (empty for session)
}
```

### Checkpoint Types

The low-level `checkpoint.Type` (from `checkpoint/checkpoint.go`) indicates storage location:

```go
type Type int

const (
    Ephemeral Type = iota // Full state snapshot, shadow branch
    Persistent            // Metadata + commit ref, entire/checkpoints/v1
)
```

| Type | Contents | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Ephemeral | Full state (code + metadata) | Intra-session rewind, pre-commit |
| Persistent | Metadata + commit reference | Permanent record, post-commit rewind |

## Interface

### Session Access

`strategy/session.go` keeps the `Session` and `Checkpoint` data types used by
status/explain formatting. Active session state is read from `.git/entire-sessions/`
through `session.StateStore`; committed checkpoint/session content is read
through the checkpoint facade (`checkpoint.Open(ctx, repo, opts)`, which resolves
the ref topology and wires the blob fetcher) and command-specific strategy
methods such as `GetSessionInfo`.

### Checkpoint Storage (Low-Level)

`checkpoint.Open` returns a `*Stores` facade exposing two independent stores,
split by lifecycle:

- `stores.Persistent` — the permanent record on `entire/checkpoints/v1`
  (a `PersistentStore`). This is the pluggable surface.
- `stores.Ephemeral()` — the git-only shadow-branch store for intra-session
  state (an `EphemeralStore`).

Both present a symmetric generic surface — `Read` (differentiated by return
type), `Write` (a sealed request union), and `List`:

```go
type PersistentStore interface {
    Read(ctx, checkpointID id.CheckpointID) (*CheckpointSummary, error)
    List(ctx) ([]CheckpointInfo, error)
    ReadSessionContent(ctx, checkpointID id.CheckpointID, sessionIndex int) (*SessionContent, error)
    Write(ctx, req WriteRequest) error    // WriteSession / BackfillTranscript / BackfillSummary / BackfillAttribution
    // ...session reads
}

type EphemeralStore interface {
    Read(ctx, baseCommit, worktreeID string) (*ReadEphemeralResult, error)
    List(ctx) ([]EphemeralInfo, error)
    Write(ctx, req EphemeralWriteRequest) (WriteEphemeralResult, error) // WriteCheckpoint / WriteTask
    // ...shadow-branch queries
}
```

Writes go through the request unions rather than per-operation methods, so a
mirror/fan-out store just forwards the request value:

```go
// Persistent: condensation, stop-time backfill, async summary, attribution
stores.Persistent.Write(ctx, checkpoint.WriteSession{CheckpointID: id, /* ... */})
stores.Persistent.Write(ctx, checkpoint.BackfillSummary{CheckpointID: id, Summary: s})

// Ephemeral: shadow-branch capture / task checkpoints
res, _ := stores.Ephemeral().Write(ctx, checkpoint.WriteCheckpoint{BaseCommit: base, /* ... */})
```

`WriteSession`/`BackfillTranscript` are defined types over the option structs
(`WriteOptions`/`UpdateOptions`); `WriteCheckpoint`/`WriteTask` over
`WriteEphemeralOptions`/`WriteEphemeralTaskOptions`.

Token usage and skill events live in the leaf `agent/types` package (so the
contract doesn't pull in the full `agent` package):

```go
type TokenUsage struct {
    InputTokens         int         `json:"input_tokens"`
    CacheCreationTokens int         `json:"cache_creation_tokens"`
    CacheReadTokens     int         `json:"cache_read_tokens"`
    OutputTokens        int         `json:"output_tokens"`
    APICallCount        int         `json:"api_call_count"`
    SubagentTokens      *TokenUsage `json:"subagent_tokens,omitempty"`
}
```

### Strategy-Level Operations

Strategies compose low-level primitives into higher-level workflows.

**Manual-commit** has condensation logic:

```go
// CondenseSession reads accumulated temporary state and writes a committed checkpoint.
func (s *ManualCommitStrategy) CondenseSession(
    repo *git.Repository,
    checkpointID id.CheckpointID,
    state *SessionState,
) (*CondenseResult, error)
```

## Storage

| Type | Location | Contents |
|------|----------|----------|
| Session State | `.git/entire-sessions/<id>.json` | Active session tracking |
| Ephemeral | `entire/<commit[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>` branch | Full state (code + metadata) |
| Persistent | `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch (sharded) | Metadata + commit reference |

### Session State

Location: `.git/entire-sessions/<session-id>.json`

Stored in git common dir (shared across worktrees). Tracks active session info.

The state records `Branch` — the branch HEAD pointed at on the session's last turn
(captured each turn start, so it follows branches created/renamed after the
session began). `entire resume` (bare, no arg) uses it to list stopped sessions
and map each back to its branch; for sessions recorded before the field existed
it falls back to deriving the branch from the session's last checkpoint ID found
in branch-only commit trailers.

`entire session adopt` moves an active session from a source repo or worktree
into the current worktree. Adoption preserves the live transcript path, validates
that the source state still belongs to the requested source worktree, rewrites
the session's branch/worktree/base metadata to the target, clears target-local
checkpoint windows and checkpoint IDs, and snapshots the target's current file
changes so the next commit can link to the adopted session.

### Temporary Checkpoints

Branch: `entire/<commit[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>`

Contains full worktree snapshot plus metadata overlay. **Multiple concurrent sessions** can share the same shadow branch - their checkpoints interleave:

```
<worktree files...>
.entire/metadata/<session-id-1>/
├── full.jsonl           # Session 1 transcript
├── prompt.txt           # Checkpoint-scoped user prompts
└── tasks/<tool-use-id>/ # Task checkpoints
.entire/metadata/<session-id-2>/
├── full.jsonl           # Session 2 transcript (concurrent)
├── ...
```

Tied to a base commit. Condensed to committed on user commit.

**Shadow branch lifecycle:**
- Created on first checkpoint for a base commit
- Migrated automatically if base commit changes (stash → pull → apply scenario)
- Deleted after condensation to `entire/checkpoints/v1`
- Reset if orphaned (no session state file exists)

### Committed Checkpoints

Branch: `entire/checkpoints/v1`

Metadata only, sharded by checkpoint ID. Supports **multiple sessions per checkpoint**:

```
<id[:2]>/<id[2:]>/
├── metadata.json        # CheckpointSummary (aggregated stats)
├── 0/                   # First session (0-based indexing)
│   ├── metadata.json    # Session-specific Metadata
│   ├── full.jsonl       # Raw agent transcript (CLI rewind/resume/explain)
│   ├── transcript.jsonl # Compact transcript, scoped to this checkpoint
│   ├── prompt.txt       # Checkpoint-scoped user prompts
│   └── content_hash.txt # sha256 of full.jsonl (dedup short-circuit)
├── 1/                   # Second session
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── full.jsonl
│   └── ...
└── 2/                   # Third session...
```

**Compact transcript (`transcript.jsonl`):** generated best-effort from
`full.jsonl` via `transcript/compact` on every committed write and on
transcript replacement during finalization. Unlike `full.jsonl` (the
cumulative session transcript, scoped at read time via
`checkpoint_transcript_start`), `transcript.jsonl` is pre-sliced to the
checkpoint's own portion (`compact.Compact` is called with
`StartLine = checkpoint_transcript_start`), so it needs no offset to consume.
It is written into the checkpoint tree and pushed alongside `full.jsonl`. The
root `metadata.json` `sessions[].transcript` pointer keeps targeting
`full.jsonl`; when a compact transcript was generated the session entry also
carries a `compact_transcript` path pointing at `transcript.jsonl` (omitted
otherwise) so external readers can find it next to `full.jsonl`.
CLI read paths (rewind/resume/explain) read `full.jsonl` by filename. Compact
generation is best-effort: failures are logged but never fail the checkpoint
write, and during finalization a failed regeneration keeps the previous
`transcript.jsonl`.

**Root-level metadata.json (`CheckpointSummary`):**
```json
{
  "cli_version": "0.0.0-dev",
  "checkpoint_version": "branch-v1",
  "checkpoint_id": "abc123def456",
  "strategy": "manual-commit",
  "branch": "main",
  "checkpoints_count": 3,
  "files_touched": ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"],
  "sessions": [
    {
      "metadata": "/ab/c123def456/0/metadata.json",
      "transcript": "/ab/c123def456/0/full.jsonl",
      "compact_transcript": "/ab/c123def456/0/transcript.jsonl",
      "content_hash": "/ab/c123def456/0/content_hash.txt",
      "prompt": "/ab/c123def456/0/prompt.txt"
    }
  ],
  "token_usage": {
    "input_tokens": 1500,
    "cache_creation_tokens": 200,
    "cache_read_tokens": 800,
    "output_tokens": 500,
    "api_call_count": 3
  }
}
```

`checkpoints_count` in the root summary is the aggregate displayed "steps" count: the sum of per-session prompt-window counts. Despite the historical name, it is not a count of checkpoint records.

**Session-level metadata.json (`Metadata`, abbreviated):**
```json
{
  "checkpoint_id": "abc123def456",
  "session_id": "2025-12-01-8f76b0e8-b8f1-4a87-9186-848bdd83d62e",
  "strategy": "manual-commit",
  "created_at": "2025-12-01T12:34:56Z",
  "branch": "main",
  "checkpoints_count": 3,
  "save_step_count": 3,
  "files_touched": ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
}
```

In session metadata, `checkpoints_count` is the displayed prompt-window count for that session. `save_step_count` records SaveStep-created shadow-branch commits and is the conservative "real checkpoint work happened" signal; it is omitted when zero (for example, commit-only/fallback sessions). `save_step_count` is not aggregated into the root `CheckpointSummary`.

When condensing multiple concurrent sessions:
- All sessions are stored in numbered subdirectories using 0-based indexing (`0/`, `1/`, `2/`, ...)
- Each `session_id` is assigned a stable index; subsequent writes for the same session reuse the same numbered folder
- New `session_id` values are appended at the next index, so higher-numbered folders correspond to more recently introduced sessions, not necessarily the chronologically latest activity
- `sessions` array in `CheckpointSummary` maps each session to its file paths
- `files_touched` is merged from all sessions

### Checkpoint Policy

Repo-wide checkpoint policy lives at `refs/entire/policies/checkpoint`. The ref
points at a commit whose tree contains `policy.json`:

```json
{
  "checkpoint_version": "branch-v1",
  "checkpoint_min_version": "branch-v1"
}
```

`checkpoint_version` is the checkpoint format new writes should use.
`checkpoint_min_version` is the oldest checkpoint format clients must be able
to read for this repo. Missing policy fields default to `branch-v1`.

Policy follows the configured checkpoint remote. `entire policy checkpoint`
fetches the latest remote policy before validating requested changes, updates
the local policy ref, and pushes only `refs/entire/policies/checkpoint`.
Policy commits use the same signing settings as checkpoint commits.

Hooks that run while ordinary git operations must keep working offline:
post-commit and agent lifecycle hooks read only the local policy ref. If the
local policy requires checkpoint writes this CLI does not support, they skip
writing checkpoint data and warn only when running in an interactive terminal.
The pre-push hook is the regular online sync point: it compares the remote
policy ref with the local ref, fetches updated policy when needed, and evaluates
the refreshed policy before pushing `entire/checkpoints/v1`. If policy refresh
fails, the hook warns or logs the failure and lets the normal push continue.

User-driven commands warn when the local policy indicates the CLI should be
upgraded. Commands that need to decode checkpoint contents, such as
`entire checkpoint explain` and `entire session resume`, fail when the target
checkpoint uses an unsupported `checkpoint_version`.

### Checkpoint ID Linking

The checkpoint ID is the **stable identifier** that links user commits to metadata across branches.

**Format:** 12-hex-character random ID (e.g., `a3b2c4d5e6f7`)

**Generation:**
- Generated during condensation (post-commit hook)

**Usage:**

1. **User commit trailer**:
   - `Entire-Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7` added to user's commit message
   - Added by `prepare-commit-msg` hook (user can remove)

2. **Directory sharding** on `entire/checkpoints/v1`:
   - Path: `<id[:2]>/<id[2:]>/` (e.g., `a3/b2c4d5e6f7/`)
   - First 2 chars = shard (256 possible shards)
   - Remaining 10 chars = directory name

3. **Commit subject** on `entire/checkpoints/v1`:
   - Format: `Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7`
   - Makes `git log entire/checkpoints/v1` readable

**Bidirectional Lookup:**

```
User commit → Metadata:
  1. Extract "Entire-Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7" from commit message
  2. Read entire/checkpoints/v1 tree at a3/b2c4d5e6f7/

Metadata → User commits:
  Given checkpoint ID a3b2c4d5e6f7
  → Search branch history for commits with "Entire-Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7"
```

Note: Commit subjects on `entire/checkpoints/v1` (e.g., `Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7`)
are for human readability in `git log` only. The CLI always reads from the tree at HEAD.

**Example Flow:**

```
                    User creates commit
                           ↓
           prepare-commit-msg hook adds trailer
                           ↓

          Condense shadow → entire/checkpoints/v1
                           ↓

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The checkpoint ID creates a **bidirectional link**: user commits can find their metadata, and metadata can find the commits that reference it.

```

Strategies use `checkpoint.Store` primitives - storage details are encapsulated.

## Strategy Role

Strategies determine checkpoint timing and type:

| Event | Checkpoint Type |
|-------|----------------|
| On Save | Temporary |
| On Task Complete | Temporary |
| On User Commit | Condense → Committed |

## Rewind

Each `RewindPoint` includes `SessionID` and `SessionPrompt` to help identify which checkpoint belongs to which session when multiple sessions are interleaved.

## Concurrent Sessions

Multiple AI sessions can run concurrently on the same base commit:

1. **Warning on start** - When a second session starts while another has uncommitted checkpoints, a warning is shown
2. **Both proceed** - User can continue; checkpoints interleave on the same shadow branch
3. **Identification** - Each checkpoint is tagged with its session ID; rewind UI shows session prompt
4. **Condensation** - On commit, all sessions are condensed together with archived subfolders

### Conflict Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Concurrent sessions (same worktree) | Warning shown, both proceed |
| Orphaned shadow branch (no state file) | Branch reset, new session proceeds |
| Cross-worktree conflict (state file exists) | `SessionIDConflictError` returned |

### Shadow Branch Migration

If user does stash → pull → apply (HEAD changes without commit):
- Detection: base commit changed AND old shadow branch still exists
- Action: branch renamed from `entire/<old-commit[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>` to `entire/<new-commit[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>`
- Result: session continues with checkpoints preserved
