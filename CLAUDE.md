# Entire - CLI

This repo contains the CLI for Entire.

## Architecture

- CLI built with github.com/spf13/cobra and github.com/charmbracelet/huh

## Key Directories

### Commands (`cmd/`)

- `entire/`: Main CLI entry point. Also home to kubectl-style external-command resolution (`entire <name>` → `entire-<name>` on PATH) — see [External Commands](docs/architecture/external-commands.md).
- `entire/cli`: CLI utilities and helpers (Cobra commands, helpers, group roots)
- `entire/cli/commands`: actual command implementations
- `entire/cli/agent`: agent implementations (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Factory AI Droid, Copilot CLI, Pi) - see [Agent Integration Checklist](docs/architecture/agent-integration-checklist.md) and [Agent Implementation Guide](docs/architecture/agent-guide.md)
- `entire/cli/strategy`: strategy implementation (manual-commit) - see section below
- `entire/cli/checkpoint`: checkpoint storage abstractions (ephemeral and persistent)
- `entire/cli/session`: session state management
- `entire/cli/integration_test`: integration tests (simulated hooks)
- `e2e/`: E2E tests with real agent calls (see [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md))

### Command Layout

The visible CLI is organized around five noun groups plus a small set of
top-level verbs. The groups are the canonical home for each verb; legacy
top-level shortcuts remain functional but hidden, and emit a deprecation hint
pointing at the canonical group form. Newer experimental command families are
discoverable through `entire labs` and may remain hidden from root help while
their canonical paths are still runnable.

- `session` (alias: `sessions`): `list`, `info`, `tokens`, `stop`, `attach`, `adopt`, `resume`, `current`.
  `resume` with a branch arg switches to it and resumes its session; with no arg
  it opens an interactive picker of stopped sessions (across all worktrees),
  resolving each to its branch and pointing at the owning worktree when the
  branch is checked out elsewhere. Resume keeps an existing local session log
  as-is by default (`--force` overwrites it from the checkpoint).
  `adopt` moves an active session from another repo or worktree into the current
  worktree and resets target-local checkpoint bookkeeping so future commits link
  to the adopted session from the new location.
- `checkpoint` (aliases: `cp`, `checkpoints`): `list`, `explain`, `tokens`, `search`, plus
  the deprecated `rewind` (functional, prints a cobra deprecation message, will
  be removed in a future release)
- `agent`: bare opens the interactive agent selector, plus `list`, `add`, `remove`
- `configure`: bare prints help and a hint pointing at `entire agent`; flags
  manage non-agent settings (telemetry, git-hook installation mode, strategy
  options, summary provider). Agent CRUD lives under `entire agent`.
- `auth`: `login`, `logout`, `status`, `contexts`, `use`, plus
  `token` (prints the active control-plane bearer to stdout for scripting/curl;
  honors `ENTIRE_TOKEN`, else the refreshed active-context login JWT). `token`
  also takes `--jurisdiction <slug>` (e.g. `us`, `eu`), which instead mints a
  jurisdictional identity token (RFC 8693 exchange, `scope=openid`,
  `aud=<jurisdiction host>`) for that jurisdiction's entire-api cells (e.g.
  `https://aws-us-east-2.api.entire.io/api/v1`), which reject the control-plane
  bearer; it exchanges `ENTIRE_TOKEN` when set (deriving the environment from the
  env token's `aud`), else the active login. `auth status` shows the caller's
  home jurisdiction so the slug is discoverable. `logout`
  takes `--everywhere` (revoke every session on the active core, not just the
  current one) and `--all-contexts` (log out of every saved login)
- `doctor`: bare runs the scan-and-fix flow, plus `trace`, `logs`, `bundle`

Experimental command families advertised through `entire labs`:

- `tokens`: `profile` (hidden from root help while token diagnostics mature)

Top-level lifecycle and standalone commands: `enable`, `disable`, `status`,
`login`, `logout`, `clean`, `version`, `dispatch`, `activity`, `help`,
`configure`, `agent-help`.

`agent-help` renders machine-readable, agent-facing usage live from the Cobra
command tree (so it always matches the installed binary): bare prints a
"when to use entire / which subcommand" map; `agent-help <command>` drills into
one command's current flags; `--json` emits structured output. It is the single
source of truth the first-turn context injection and the `--agent-help-skill`
skill point agents at, instead of enumerating a surface that goes stale.
Hidden commands opt into being advertised here by setting
`Annotations[agentHelpAnnotation] = "true"` (e.g. `trail`).
No-channel agents (Cursor, Copilot CLI, Factory Droid, MCP hosts — no
context-injection channel and no agent-help skill template) reach it without an
active push. All of them can discover it passively: it is visible in `entire
help`, the `entire status` footer points at it, and `entire status --json`
exposes it as the `agent_help` field. On top of that, Factory AI Droid (which is
banner-only) gets the pointer appended to its SessionStart hook banner, and
MCP-host agents can launch the hidden `entire mcp` stdio server, which exposes
`agent_help` and `entire_status` as MCP tools using the same live rendering.
Enabling a no-channel agent with `--agent-help-skill` reports the skill
unsupported and points the agent at this passive path instead.

Hidden top-level shortcuts (functional, emit a one-line deprecation hint):
`resume` → `session resume`, `attach` → `session attach`, `explain` →
`checkpoint explain`, `trace` → `doctor trace`.
Cobra-native aliases (no hint): `sessions` → `session`, `cp`/`checkpoints` →
`checkpoint`. The `search` top-level remains hidden without a hint.

Deprecated top-level commands (functional, print a cobra deprecation message):
`reset` → `clean`, and `rewind` (no replacement, announces removal — same
deprecation as `checkpoint rewind`).

Hidden infrastructure commands: `hooks`, `trail`,
`curl-bash-post-install`, `__send_analytics`, `mcp` (MCP stdio server for
MCP-host agents).

The `hideAsAlias(cmd, canonical)` helper in `cmd/entire/cli/aliascmd.go`
marks a command Hidden and sets cobra's `Deprecated` field so the hint
renders to stderr on every invocation while the command stays functional.
Diagnostic subcommands live alongside `doctor.go` as `doctor_logs.go` and
`doctor_bundle.go`. Group roots and noun-group children live in files
named `<noun>_group.go` and `<noun>_<verb>.go` respectively.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Go 1.26.x
- Build tool: mise, go modules
- Linting: golangci-lint

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
mise run test
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
mise run test:integration
```

### Running All Tests (CI)

```bash
mise run test:ci
```

This runs unit tests, integration tests, and the E2E canary (Vogon agent) in sequence. Integration tests use the `//go:build integration` build tag and are located in `cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/`.

### Running E2E Canary Tests (Vogon Agent)

The Vogon agent is a deterministic fake agent that exercises the full E2E test suite without making any API calls.

```bash
mise run test:e2e:canary           # Run all E2E tests with the Vogon agent
mise run test:e2e:canary TestFoo   # Run a specific test
```

- **Runs as part of `test:ci`** — canary failures block merges
- **No API calls, no cost** — safe to run freely, unlike real agent E2E tests
- **If a canary test fails, the bug is in the CLI or test infrastructure**, not in an agent
- Located in `e2e/vogon/` (binary) and `cmd/entire/cli/agent/vogon/` (Agent interface)
- The binary parses prompts via regex, creates/modifies/deletes files, and fires lifecycle hooks
- **IMPORTANT: When changing E2E test prompt wording**, the Vogon binary (`e2e/vogon/main.go`) parses prompts with hardcoded regexes. New phrasing may not match existing patterns — always run `mise run test:e2e:canary` after changing prompt text and fix Vogon's parsing if tests fail.

### Running E2E Tests (Only When Explicitly Requested)

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT run E2E tests proactively.** E2E tests make real API calls to agents, which consume tokens and cost money. Only run them when the user explicitly asks for E2E testing.

```bash
mise run test:e2e [filter]                          # All agents, filtered
mise run test:e2e --agent claude-code [filter]       # Claude Code only as an example here, replace `claude-code` with other agents to run tests for those agents
```

E2E tests:

- Use the `//go:build e2e` build tag
- Located in `e2e/tests/`
- See [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md) for full documentation (structure, debugging, adding agents)
- Test real agent interactions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Factory AI Droid, Copilot CLI, Pi, or Vogon creating files, committing, etc.)
- Validate checkpoint scenarios documented in `docs/architecture/checkpoint-scenarios.md`
- Support multiple agents via `E2E_AGENT` env var (`claude-code`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `cursor`, `factoryai-droid`, `copilot-cli`, `pi`, `vogon`)

**Environment variables:**

- `E2E_AGENT` - Agent to test with (default: `claude-code`)
- `E2E_CLAUDE_MODEL` - Claude model to use (default: `haiku` for cost efficiency)
- `E2E_TIMEOUT` - Timeout per prompt (default: `2m`)

### Test Parallelization

**Always use `t.Parallel()` in tests.** Every top-level test function and subtest should call `t.Parallel()` unless it modifies process-global state (e.g., `os.Chdir()`).

```go
func TestFeature_Foo(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    // ...
}

// Integration tests with TestEnv
func TestFeature_Bar(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    env := NewFeatureBranchEnv(t)
    // ...
}
```

**Exception:** Tests that modify process-global state cannot be parallelized. This includes `os.Chdir()`/`t.Chdir()` and `os.Setenv()`/`t.Setenv()` — Go's test framework will panic if these are used after `t.Parallel()`.

### Git in Tests

**Tests that touch git state must use an isolated temp repo — never the real repo CWD.**

Many handlers (lifecycle, strategy, hooks) resolve the git repo from CWD via `OpenRepository`, `GetGitCommonDir`, `DetectFileChanges`, etc. Without isolation, tests can create session state files, shadow branches, or other artifacts in the real `.git/` directory.

Use the `testutil` helpers:

```go
tmpDir := t.TempDir()
testutil.InitRepo(t, tmpDir)                    // git init + user config + disable GPG
testutil.WriteFile(t, tmpDir, "f.txt", "init")  // create a file
testutil.GitAdd(t, tmpDir, "f.txt")             // stage it
testutil.GitCommit(t, tmpDir, "init")           // commit (needs at least one commit for HEAD)
t.Chdir(tmpDir)                                 // redirect CWD-based git resolution
```

`testutil.InitRepo` configures `user.name`, `user.email`, and disables GPG signing — safe for CI environments without global git config.

**Prefer `testutil.InitRepo()` over direct `git.PlainInit()` in tests.** When a test in this repo needs an initialized repository, use `testutil.InitRepo(t, dir)` unless the test specifically needs lower-level initialization behavior that the helper cannot provide. Do not call `git.PlainInit()` directly and then create commits or run CLI git operations without also reproducing the helper's repo-local config.

**Do NOT** shell out to `git init`/`git commit` directly without setting user config and `--no-gpg-sign`, and **do NOT** run lifecycle/strategy handlers from the real repo CWD in tests.

### Config/Cache/Keyring Isolation in Tests

Tests must never read or write the developer's real `~/.config/entire`
(contexts.json, version_check.json), `~/.cache/entire` (nodes.json,
cluster_cores.json, api_discovery.json), or OS keychain. The developer may be
using `entire` for real while tests run.

- **Single resolver**: `internal/entireclient/userdirs` is the only place
  that resolves the per-user config dir (`userdirs.Config()`:
  `$ENTIRE_CONFIG_DIR` else `~/.config/entire`) and cache dir
  (`userdirs.Cache()`: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/entire` else `~/.cache/entire`).
  Never derive these paths anywhere else.
- **In-process safety net**: `userdirs` and the `tokenstore` default backend
  detect `go test` (via `internal/testdirs`) and fall back to a throwaway
  per-process temp directory when their env override is unset. The fallback
  is shared across tests in one process — for per-test isolation still set
  `t.Setenv("ENTIRE_CONFIG_DIR", t.TempDir())` and
  `tokenstore.UseFileBackendForTesting(...)`.
- **Spawned binaries are NOT covered**: `testing.Testing()` is false in a
  subprocess. The integration and e2e TestMains set `ENTIRE_CONFIG_DIR`,
  `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `ENTIRE_TOKEN_STORE=file`, `ENTIRE_TOKEN_STORE_PATH`, and
  `ENTIRE_TEST_AUTH_STORE_FILE` process-wide so every spawned `entire` (and
  every agent-invoked hook) inherits isolation. Any new harness that spawns
  the real binary must do the same.
- **Legacy auth store**: `auth.NewStore()` talks straight to the zalando
  keyring; packages whose tests can reach it need `keyring.MockInit()` in
  `TestMain` (see `cmd/entire/cli/global_test.go`) — the `testdirs` fallback
  does not cover it in-process.

### Spawning subprocesses in tests (TTY detection)

Tests that spawn the real `entire` or `git` binary need the child to be non-interactive so prompts don't hang on a developer terminal.

`interactive.CanPromptInteractively()` resolves in this order:

1. `ENTIRE_TEST_TTY=1` → force interactive ON (any other non-empty value → force OFF).
2. `testing.Testing()` → false. In-process `go test` runs are non-interactive by default; no per-test `t.Setenv("ENTIRE_TEST_TTY", "0")` is needed.
3. Agent sentinels (`GEMINI_CLI`, `COPILOT_CLI`, `PI_CODING_AGENT`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) → false.
4. `CI=<non-empty-non-false>` → false.
5. `/dev/tty` probe.

For subprocesses spawning the real `entire` binary (e2e, integration tests, `entire` calling itself from a hook), prefer `execx.NonInteractive` over env-var plumbing:

```go
import "github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire/cli/execx"

cmd := execx.NonInteractive(ctx, getTestBinary(), "status")
cmd.Dir = repoDir
out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
```

`execx.NonInteractive` puts the child in a new session with no controlling terminal (`Setsid` on Unix, `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` on Windows), so the child's `/dev/tty` probe fails naturally. No env var required.

`interactive.UnderTest()` returns true when `testing.Testing()` or `ENTIRE_TEST_TTY` is set — use it where code needs to skip a real-terminal operation even if `CanPromptInteractively()` returns true (e.g., reading from `/dev/tty` directly inside `askConfirmTTY`).

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
mise run fmt && mise run lint
```

`mise run fmt` can rewrite files. Treat `mise run fmt && mise run lint` as a single verification sequence: if formatting changes anything, run lint again on the formatted tree rather than assuming a previous lint result still applies.

### Before Every Commit (REQUIRED)

**CI will fail if you skip these steps:**

```bash
mise run check
```

Equivalent expanded form:

```bash
mise run fmt      # Format code (CI enforces gofmt)
mise run lint     # Lint check (CI enforces golangci-lint)
mise run test:ci  # Run all tests (unit + integration)
```

`mise run check` runs the three commands above.

Safety note: do not treat a clean `mise run lint` result as final unless it was run after the most recent `mise run fmt` pass.

### Before Any Push Or Remote Code Update (REQUIRED)

Before pushing commits or otherwise sending code changes to any remote, run `mise run lint` on the current tree and ensure it passes. If `mise run fmt` changed files, rerun `mise run lint` on the formatted tree before pushing.

**Common CI failures from skipping this:**

- `gofmt` formatting differences → run `mise run fmt`
- Lint errors → run `mise run lint` and fix issues
- Test failures → run `mise run test` and fix

### Code Duplication Prevention

Before implementing Go code, use `/go:discover-related` to find existing utilities and patterns that might be reusable.

**Check for duplication:**

```bash
mise run dup           # Comprehensive check (threshold 50) with summary
mise run dup:staged    # Check only staged files
mise run lint          # Normal lint includes dupl at threshold 75 (new issues only)
mise run lint:full     # All issues at threshold 75
```

**Tiered thresholds:**

- **75 tokens** (lint/CI) - Blocks on serious duplication (~20+ lines)
- **50 tokens** (dup) - Advisory, catches smaller patterns (~10+ lines)

When duplication is found:

1. Check if a helper already exists in `common.go` or nearby utility files
2. If not, consider extracting the duplicated logic to a shared helper
3. If duplication is intentional (e.g., test setup), add a `//nolint:dupl` comment with explanation

## Code Patterns

### Error Handling

The CLI uses a specific pattern for error output to avoid duplication between Cobra and main.go.

**How it works:**

- `root.go` sets `SilenceErrors: true` globally - Cobra never prints errors
- `main.go` prints errors to stderr, unless the error is a `SilentError`
- Commands return `NewSilentError(err)` when they've already printed a custom message

**When to use `SilentError`:**
Use `NewSilentError()` when you want to print a custom, user-friendly error message instead of the raw error:

```go
// In a command's RunE function:
if _, err := paths.WorktreeRoot(); err != nil {
    cmd.SilenceUsage = true  // Don't show usage for prerequisite errors
    fmt.Fprintln(cmd.ErrOrStderr(), "Not a git repository. Please run 'entire enable' from within a git repository.")
    return NewSilentError(errors.New("not a git repository"))
}
```

**When NOT to use `SilentError`:**
For normal errors where the default error message is sufficient, return the error directly. main.go will print it:

```go
// Normal error - main.go will print "unknown strategy: foo"
return fmt.Errorf("unknown strategy: %s", name)
```

**Key files:**

- `errors.go` - Defines `SilentError` type and `NewSilentError()` constructor
- `root.go` - Sets `SilenceErrors: true` on root command
- `main.go` - Checks for `SilentError` before printing

### Settings

All settings access should go through the `settings` package (`cmd/entire/cli/settings/`).

**Why a separate package:**
The `settings` package exists to avoid import cycles. The `cli` package imports `strategy`, so `strategy` cannot import `cli`. The `settings` package provides shared settings loading that both can use.

**Usage:**

```go
import "github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire/cli/settings"

// Load full settings object
s, err := settings.Load()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
if s.Enabled {
    // ...
}

// Or use convenience functions
if settings.IsSummarizeEnabled() {
    // ...
}
```

**Do NOT:**

- Read `.entire/settings.json` or `.entire/settings.local.json` directly with `os.ReadFile`
- Duplicate settings parsing logic in other packages
- Create new settings helpers without adding them to the `settings` package

**Key files:**

- `settings/settings.go` - `EntireSettings` struct, `Load()`, and helper methods
- `config.go` - Higher-level config functions that use settings (for `cli` package consumers)

### Logging vs User Output

- **Internal/debug logging**: Use `logging.Debug/Info/Warn/Error(ctx, msg, attrs...)` from `cmd/entire/cli/logging/`. Writes to `.entire/logs/`.
- **Enabling debug/perf logs locally**: Prefer adding `"log_level": "DEBUG"` to `.entire/settings.local.json` when you need detailed hook/perf logs. This file is gitignored. `ENTIRE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` also works and takes precedence.
- **User-facing output**: Use `fmt.Fprint*(cmd.OutOrStdout(), ...)` or `cmd.ErrOrStderr()`.

Don't use `fmt.Print*` for operational messages (checkpoint saves, hook invocations, strategy decisions) - those should use the `logging` package.

**Privacy**: Don't log user content (prompts, file contents, commit messages). Log only operational metadata (IDs, counts, paths, durations).

### Git Operations

We use github.com/go-git/go-git for most git operations, but with important exceptions:

#### go-git v5 Bugs - Use CLI Instead

**Do NOT use go-git v5 for `checkout` or `reset --hard` operations.**

go-git v5 has a bug where `worktree.Reset()` with `git.HardReset` and `worktree.Checkout()` incorrectly delete untracked directories even when they're listed in `.gitignore`. This would destroy `.entire/` and `.worktrees/` directories.

Use the git CLI instead:

```go
// WRONG - go-git deletes ignored directories
worktree.Reset(&git.ResetOptions{
    Commit: hash,
    Mode:   git.HardReset,
})

// CORRECT - use git CLI
cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "git", "reset", "--hard", hash.String())
```

See `HardResetWithProtection()` in `common.go` and `CheckoutBranch()` in `git_operations.go` for examples.

Regression tests in `hard_reset_test.go` verify this behavior - if go-git v6 fixes this issue, those tests can be used to validate switching back.

#### Repo Root vs Current Working Directory

**Always use repo root (not `os.Getwd()`) when working with git-relative paths.**

Git commands like `git status` and `worktree.Status()` return paths relative to the **repository root**, not the current working directory. When an agent runs from a subdirectory (e.g., `/repo/frontend`), using `os.Getwd()` to construct absolute paths will produce incorrect results for files in sibling directories.

```go
// WRONG - breaks when running from subdirectory
cwd, _ := os.Getwd()  // e.g., /repo/frontend
absPath := filepath.Join(cwd, file)  // file="api/src/types.ts" → /repo/frontend/api/src/types.ts (WRONG)

// CORRECT - use repo root
repoRoot, _ := paths.WorktreeRoot()
absPath := filepath.Join(repoRoot, file)  // → /repo/api/src/types.ts (CORRECT)
```

This also affects path filtering. The `paths.ToRelativePath()` function rejects paths starting with `..`, so computing relative paths from cwd instead of repo root will filter out files in sibling directories:

```go
// WRONG - filters out sibling directory files
cwd, _ := os.Getwd()  // /repo/frontend
relPath := paths.ToRelativePath("/repo/api/file.ts", cwd)  // returns "" (filtered out as "../api/file.ts")

// CORRECT - keeps all repo files
repoRoot, _ := paths.WorktreeRoot()
relPath := paths.ToRelativePath("/repo/api/file.ts", repoRoot)  // returns "api/file.ts"
```

**When to use `os.Getwd()`:** Only when you actually need the current directory (e.g., finding agent session directories that are cwd-relative).

**When to use repo root:** Any time you're working with paths from git status, git diff, or any git-relative file list.

Test case in `state_test.go`: `TestFilterAndNormalizePaths_SiblingDirectories` documents this bug pattern.

### Control-Plane Core Resolution (which core am I talking to?)

Control-plane commands dial one of three cores: the active context's
(`coreapi.New`), a specific cluster's (`coreapi.NewForCluster`), or — when
`ENTIRE_TOKEN` is set — the env token's `aud` (the bypass inside `New`/
`NewForCluster`). This precedence lives **only** inside `coreapi`; nothing else
re-derives it.

**To display which core a request uses, ask the client: `client.CoreOrigin()`.**
It returns whatever was actually wired in, so the shown core can never diverge
from where the request goes. **Do NOT** re-resolve with
`auth.ResolveControlPlaneTarget()` for display — it only knows the active
context and silently ignores both `ENTIRE_TOKEN` and the cluster case, so it can
name a core the request never touches (this was a real bug in the `mirror list`
banner; see `repo_mirror.go` and `coreapi.Client.CoreOrigin`).

When a command resolves auth *outside* a `coreapi.Client` (e.g. `entire auth
status`, which builds its own `/me` client), it must apply the same
env-token-first precedence itself — see `resolveAuthStatusTarget` /
`resolveEnvTokenStatusTarget` in `auth.go`, which branch on
`auth.EnvTokenVar` before falling back to the active context. `logout` is the
deliberate exception: it manages a *stored* login session, which an ephemeral
env token has none of, so it stays on the active context.

### Entire-API Cell Routing (which cell does a data-plane request go to?)

The data plane (entire-api) is deployed per jurisdiction; a repo placement
lives in exactly one cell, user `/me/*` activity is consolidated in the
caller's home cell, and no server-side cross-cell aggregator exists. The CLI
therefore has exactly three routing shapes, mirroring the entire.io BFF:

- **Repo-scoped → one cell**: `resolveRepoCellTarget` (`cell_target.go`) maps
  a repo (ULID or owner/repo) to the cell hosting it via mirrors + the cluster
  catalog. Best-effort: any failure returns nil and the auth layer falls back
  to home-jurisdiction routing. Used by experts
  (`NewAuthenticatedEntireAPICellClient` in `api_client.go`).
- **User-scoped `/me` → home cell, never fan out**:
  `auth.NewEntireAPICellClient(ctx, insecure, nil)` routes by the
  `home_jurisdiction` JWT claim; activity/recap use it with a data-API
  fallback (`runAuthenticatedActivityAPI` in `entireapi_client.go`).
- **Repo-set queries → fan out and merge client-side**: `cell_fanout.go` —
  `groupReposByCell` (repo index → per-cell groups; the catalog join key is
  `ClusterSlug`↔`Cluster.Slug`, NOT the cell name, which the catalog does not
  expose), `resolveCellBaseURLs`, and `fanOutCells` (parallel per-cell calls,
  per-cell timeout, partial failures isolated per slot). Merge semantics stay
  with the command.

Token rule: identity tokens are **per-jurisdiction, not per-cell**. Multi-cell
callers must build one `auth.CellClientFactory`
(`NewEntireAPICellClientFactory`) per operation — it resolves the login
subject once and mints at most one token per jurisdiction. `fanOutCells` does
this automatically; do not call `NewEntireAPICellClient` in a loop.

### Session Strategy (`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/`)

The CLI uses a manual-commit strategy for managing session data and checkpoints. The strategy implements the `Strategy` interface defined in `strategy.go`.

#### Strategy Interface

The `Strategy` interface provides:

- `SaveStep()` - Save session step checkpoint (code + metadata)
- `SaveTaskStep()` - Save subagent task step checkpoint
- `GetRewindPoints()` / `Rewind()` - List and restore to checkpoints
- `GetSessionLog()` / `GetSessionInfo()` - Retrieve session data

#### How It Works

The manual-commit strategy (`manual_commit*.go`) does not modify the active branch - no commits are created on the working branch. Instead it:

- Creates shadow branch `entire/<HEAD-commit-hash[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>` per base commit + worktree
- **Worktree-specific branches** - each git worktree gets its own shadow branch namespace, preventing conflicts
- **Supports multiple concurrent sessions** - checkpoints from different sessions in the same directory interleave on the same shadow branch
- Condenses session logs to permanent `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch on user commits
- Each committed session stores the raw transcript (`full.jsonl`, read by CLI rewind/resume/explain) plus a best-effort compact transcript (`transcript.jsonl`, generated via `transcript/compact`). Like `full.jsonl`, `transcript.jsonl` stores the **full compacted session** on every checkpoint (via `compact.FullWithBoundary`), so each checkpoint is self-contained and the session survives a mid-history checkpoint being lost/reverted/rebased. This checkpoint's slice begins at the session metadata's `compact_transcript_start` (a line offset in compact-output coordinates, distinct from `checkpoint_transcript_start` which indexes raw `full.jsonl` lines); a nil/absent marker means a legacy delta-only `transcript.jsonl` (read from line 0). The marker rounds toward inclusion when a streaming message straddles the boundary, so the slice never drops this checkpoint's content but may repeat ≤1 merged line at its head. Compact generation is best-effort and is skipped when the compacted output exceeds the 50MB blob cap (unlike `full.jsonl`, `transcript.jsonl` is not chunked — `full.jsonl` stays authoritative and the compact is regenerable); in the OPF finalize rewrite a failed/skipped regeneration drops the prior `transcript.jsonl` and clears the marker rather than shipping a stale, less-redacted compact. Both files are pushed with the v1 branch. The root `metadata.json` `sessions[].transcript` pointer keeps targeting `full.jsonl`; when the compact transcript was generated the session entry also carries a `compact_transcript` path pointing at `transcript.jsonl` (omitted otherwise) so external readers can locate it next to `full.jsonl`.
- Uses the `post-rewrite` Git hook to keep local session linkage aligned after amend/rebase rewrites
- Builds git trees in-memory using go-git plumbing APIs
- Rewind restores files from shadow branch commit tree (does not use `git reset`)
- **Location-independent transcript resolution** - transcript paths are always computed dynamically from the current repo location (via `agent.GetSessionDir` + `agent.ResolveSessionFile`), never stored in checkpoint metadata. This ensures restore/rewind works after repo relocation or across machines.
- **Token usage scoping** - `SessionState.TokenUsage` is the session-wide total used by `entire status`; `SessionState.CheckpointTokenUsage` is the pending checkpoint delta since the last condensation. Checkpoint metadata must stay scoped to `CheckpointTranscriptStart` or the pending checkpoint delta. Cursor tokens come only from stop-hook payloads, while Copilot CLI can also backfill full-session totals from `session.shutdown`.
- Tracks session state in `.git/entire-sessions/` (shared across worktrees)
- **Shadow branch migration** - if user does stash/pull/rebase (HEAD changes without commit), shadow branch is automatically moved to new base commit
- **Orphaned branch cleanup** - if a shadow branch exists without a corresponding session state file, it is automatically reset when a new session starts
- PrePush hook can push `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch alongside user pushes
- **OPF (OpenAI Privacy Filter) runs at pre-push, not post-commit**: when `redaction.openai_privacy_filter.enabled` is true, the PrePush hook re-redacts unpushed `entire/checkpoints/v1` commits with the OPF 8th layer, builds new commits carrying an `Entire-OPF-Applied: true` trailer, and atomically updates the local v1 ref before pushing. Per-commit condensation stays on the fast 7-layer pipeline. See `strategy/manual_commit_opf_rewrite.go` and `docs/security-and-privacy.md` for the full flow, including divergence detection, bootstrap caps, and CAS-on-conflict semantics.
- Safe to use on main/master since it never modifies commit history

#### Key Files

- `strategy.go` - Interface definition and context structs (`StepContext`, `TaskStepContext`, `RewindPoint`, etc.)
- `common.go` - Helpers for metadata extraction, tree building, rewind validation, `ListCheckpoints()`
- `manual_commit*.go` - Manual-commit strategy: main impl, types, session state, condensation, rewind, git ops, logs, hook handlers (prepare-commit-msg, post-commit, post-rewrite, pre-push), reset
- `manual_commit_opf_rewrite.go` - Pre-push OPF re-redaction: walks unpushed v1 commits, runs OPF over their blobs, rebuilds commits with `Entire-OPF-Applied: true` trailer, CAS-updates the local ref. Sentinel error types (use `errors.As`): `V1DivergedError`, `BootstrapTooLargeError`, `V1RefMovedError`, `OPFRuntimeFailedError`.
- `cleanup.go` - Cleanup discovery/deletion for shadow branches, session states, and checkpoint metadata
- `session_state.go` - Package-level session state functions
- `hooks.go` - Git hook installation

Note: `checkpoint/configloader.go` overrides go-git's default config loader with a symlink-following `billy.Basic` (`osSymlinkFS`) — go-git's default reads config via `os.Root`, which rejects absolute symlinks in any path component (e.g. a `~/.config` managed by a dotfile tool), silently dropping global config so author identity fell back to "Unknown" and signing was skipped.

#### Deep-Dive Reference

The phase state machine, metadata directory layout, sharded checkpoint format, multi-session metadata, checkpoint ID linking, commit trailers, and concurrent-session / shadow-branch-migration behavior are documented in:

- [Sessions and Checkpoints](docs/architecture/sessions-and-checkpoints.md) - domain model, storage layout, checkpoint ID linking, commit trailers, package structure
- [Checkpoint Scenarios](docs/architecture/checkpoint-scenarios.md) - phase state machine and worked condensation scenarios

#### When Modifying the Strategy

- The strategy must implement the full `Strategy` interface
- Test with `mise run test` - strategy tests are in `*_test.go` files
- Keep this file and `docs/architecture/sessions-and-checkpoints.md` current when changing strategy behavior (`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file)

### `entire review` Command

`entire review` runs a configured review profile. Keep documentation brief and user-facing.

See [Review Command](docs/architecture/review-command.md) for usage, minimal profile config, and key files.

### Agent-Safe CLI Fallbacks

When building CLI features, do not make useful output available only through a
TUI, picker, wizard, terminal selection menu, confirmation dialog, or stdin
question. Agents must be able to complete the same read-only workflow from a
non-interactive terminal.

Plain text output is acceptable when it contains the full information needed for
the workflow. JSON is preferred for structured data, following existing patterns
such as `--json` on `status`, `agent-help`, `sessions`, `search`, and trail
finding commands. Long human-readable output may use a pager in TTY mode, but
must provide a bypass like the existing `--no-pager` pattern on `explain`.

For interactive browsing flows, provide one of these non-interactive shapes:

- a list command that prints stable identifiers, plus a show/detail command that
  accepts an identifier
- a flag or positional argument that selects the item directly
- a complete text or JSON fallback when stdout is not a terminal, like existing
  static/text fallbacks for TUI-backed commands

When reviewing CLI changes, inspect terminal-gated paths such as
`IsTerminalWriter`, `CanPromptInteractively`, Bubble Tea, `huh`, direct stdin
reads, terminal selection menus, confirmation dialogs, and wizard flows. Flag
the change if a non-interactive agent can only see a menu, preview, truncated
summary, or cannot select the item whose details matter.

Tests for interactive CLI features should cover the non-interactive path. See
the "Spawning subprocesses in tests (TTY detection)" section above for the
`execx.NonInteractive` pattern when testing a real `entire` command.

Existing good patterns:

- `entire investigate --findings` prints a complete plain-text list and includes
  `view: entire investigate show <run-id>` hints.
- `entire investigate show <run-id>` prints the saved investigation summary and
  findings without needing a TUI.
- `entire repo clone /gh/...` prompts only when several clusters are possible;
  without a TTY it asks for `--cluster`.
- `entire experts --tui` is safe because the TUI is opt-in and non-TTY output
  falls back to deterministic plain text.
- `entire explain --no-pager` is the local pattern for avoiding pager-only long
  text output.
- `entire status --json`, `entire agent-help --json`, `entire sessions list --json`,
  and trail finding commands show the local `--json` convention.

Do not require JSON everywhere. Human-readable text is fine if it contains the
complete information an agent needs. The failure mode is requiring an
interactive terminal to select something or reveal details.

# Important Notes

- **Before committing:** Follow the "Before Every Commit (REQUIRED)" checklist above - CI will fail without it
- Integration tests: run `mise run test:integration` when changing integration test code
- When adding new features, ensure they are well-tested and documented.
- Always check for code duplication and refactor as needed.

## Go Code Style

- Write lint-compliant Go code on the first attempt. Before outputting Go code, mentally verify it passes `golangci-lint` (or your specific linter).
- Follow standard Go idioms: proper error handling, no unused variables/imports, correct formatting (gofmt), meaningful names.
- Handle all errors explicitly—don't leave them unchecked.
- Reference `.golangci.yml` for enabled linters before writing Go code.

## Accessibility

The CLI supports an accessibility mode for users who rely on screen readers. This mode uses simpler text prompts instead of interactive TUI elements.

### Environment Variable

- `ACCESSIBLE=1` (or any non-empty value) enables accessibility mode
- Users can set this in their shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) for persistent use

### Implementation Guidelines

When adding new interactive forms or prompts using `huh`:

**In the `cli` package:**
Use `NewAccessibleForm()` instead of `huh.NewForm()`:

```go
// Good - respects ACCESSIBLE env var
form := NewAccessibleForm(
    huh.NewGroup(
        huh.NewSelect[string]().
            Title("Choose an option").
            Options(...).
            Value(&choice),
    ),
)

// Bad - ignores accessibility setting
form := huh.NewForm(...)
```

**In the `strategy` package:**
Use the `isAccessibleMode()` helper. Note that `WithAccessible()` is only available on forms, not individual fields, so wrap confirmations in a form:

```go
form := huh.NewForm(
    huh.NewGroup(
        huh.NewConfirm().
            Title("Confirm action?").
            Value(&confirmed),
    ),
)
if isAccessibleMode() {
    form = form.WithAccessible(true)
}
if err := form.Run(); err != nil { ... }
```

### Key Points

- Always use the accessibility helpers for any `huh` forms/prompts
- Test new interactive features with `ACCESSIBLE=1` to ensure they work
- The accessible mode is documented in `--help` output
